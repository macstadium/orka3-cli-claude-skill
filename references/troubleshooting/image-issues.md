# Image Management Troubleshooting

This guide covers common image-related issues with the Orka3 CLI.

## Problem: Async image operations stuck in progress

**Symptoms:**
- `orka3 image list` shows image but with errors
- Image save/commit/copy not completing
- "Operation in progress" for extended time

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check image status with extended output
orka3 image list <IMAGE_NAME> --output wide

# Look for error messages or status indicators
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Wait longer - large images take time
# 90GB+ images can take 10-30+ minutes

# 2. If stuck for hours, contact MacStadium support

# 3. For save/commit operations - ensure source VM is stable
orka3 vm list <SOURCE_VM> --output wide

# 4. Avoid concurrent operations on same image
# Wait for one operation to complete before starting another
```

## Problem: Cannot delete image (in use)

**Symptoms:**
- "Image is in use by VM"
- "Cannot delete image"

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Find VMs using the image
orka3 vm list --output wide | grep <IMAGE_NAME>

# Find VM configs using the image
orka3 vmc list --output wide | grep <IMAGE_NAME>
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Option 1: Delete VMs using the image
orka3 vm delete <VM_NAME>

# Option 2: Delete or update VM configs
orka3 vmc delete <CONFIG_NAME>
# OR update config to use different image

# Then try deletion again
orka3 image delete <IMAGE_NAME>

# For Intel: Ensure image is not in use by ANY VM
# For Apple Silicon: Image can be deleted if only used by one VM
```

## Problem: Image cache not working (Apple Silicon)

**Symptoms:**
- `imagecache add` succeeds but deployments still slow
- `imagecache info` shows "not ready" indefinitely

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check caching status
orka3 ic info <IMAGE>

# Verify nodes have the image cached
orka3 ic list --output wide
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Wait for caching to complete (can take time for large images)
watch -n 30 'orka3 ic info <IMAGE>'

# 2. Verify registry credentials exist for OCI images
orka3 regcred list

# For private registries:
orka3 regcred add <REGISTRY_URL> --username <USER> --password <TOKEN>

# 3. Try caching on specific nodes
orka3 ic add <IMAGE> --nodes <NODE_NAME>

# 4. Check node storage capacity
orka3 node list --output wide

# 5. If cache fails persistently, contact MacStadium support
```

## Problem: "Invalid image format"

**Cause:** Incorrect OCI image path

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use full OCI path with registry
orka3 vm deploy --image ghcr.io/org/repo/image:tag

# Verify registry credentials exist
orka3 regcred list
```

## Problem: Image push fails (Apple Silicon)

**Symptoms:**
- `orka3 vm push` command fails
- Push job stuck or errored

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check push status
orka3 vm get-push-status

# List all push jobs
orka3 vm get-push-status --output wide
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Verify registry credentials
orka3 regcred list

# 2. Ensure credentials are in the same namespace as the VM
orka3 regcred add <REGISTRY_URL> --username <USER> --password <TOKEN> --namespace <VM_NAMESPACE>

# 3. Verify image format is correct
# Format: server.com/repository/image:tag
orka3 vm push <VM_NAME> ghcr.io/org/repo/image:tag

# 4. Check VM is running and stable
orka3 vm list <VM_NAME> --output wide

# 5. Try with different tag
orka3 vm push <VM_NAME> ghcr.io/org/repo/image:new-tag
```

## Problem: Image copy operation slow or failing

**Symptoms:**
- `orka3 image copy` taking very long
- Copy operation stuck

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Check image size (large images take longer)
orka3 image list <SOURCE_IMAGE> --output wide

# 2. Monitor copy progress
orka3 image list <DESTINATION_IMAGE> --output wide

# 3. Avoid starting multiple copy operations simultaneously

# 4. For very large images, expect 30+ minutes
```

## Image Operation Timing Reference

| Operation | Typical Duration | Factors |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| image list | Instant | - |
| image copy | 5-30+ minutes | Image size |
| image delete | Instant | - |
| vm save | 5-30+ minutes | Image size, VM disk usage |
| vm commit | 5-30+ minutes | Image size, VM disk usage |
| vm push | 10-60+ minutes | Image size, network speed |
| imagecache add | 5-30+ minutes | Image size, number of nodes |

## Best Practices for Image Operations

1. **Check status of async operations** - Don't assume completion
2. **Avoid concurrent operations** - One operation per image at a time
3. **Use descriptive names** - Include version or date in names
4. **Test images before deployment** - Verify with single VM first
5. **Clean up unused images** - Regularly remove old images
6. **Cache images before mass deployment** - Improves consistency
