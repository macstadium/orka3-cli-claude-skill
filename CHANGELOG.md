# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed

- Release workflow: added `workflow_dispatch` fallback so releases can be manually triggered from the Actions tab when tag-push triggers don't fire (known GitHub Actions quirk with tags created through the Releases UI)

### Changed

- Updated `SKILL.md` frontmatter description to include "command syntax", "flag reference", and "exact flags and options" — signals Claude to invoke the skill when it needs CLI syntax help, not just for natural-language VM management requests
- Added "What Is a Claude Code Skill?" section to README explaining auto-discovery, `/orka3-cli` slash command, and auto-invocation
- Added post-install verification step to README

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-11

### Changed

- Moved skill content (`SKILL.md`, `references/`) into `skill/` subdirectory to separate installable content from development artifacts
- Updated installation instructions: download `.skill` from GitHub Releases or copy `skill/*`
- Updated Claude Desktop instructions to reference `.skill` archive upload

### Added

- `scripts/build-skill.sh` — builds a `.skill` zip archive from `skill/` directory
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — tag-triggered pipeline that creates GitHub Releases with `.skill` archive attached
- `.gitignore` for build artifacts, OS files, and editor files
- "Building from Source" section in README

### Removed

- `orka3-skill-combined.md` — 97KB maintenance burden; users should install the skill or reference individual files instead
- `references/archive/` — superseded v1.0.0 monolithic files (preserved in git history)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added

- Orka 3.5.2 features in `SKILL.md`: namespace auto-detection, shared attached disks, macOS Tahoe/Sequoia compatibility
- Log sources reference (v3.4+) in `SKILL.md` and deployment troubleshooting
- Shared disk workflows (`references/workflows/shared-disk-workflows.md`)
- Default namespace detection section in `references/commands/config-commands.md`
- Combined skill file (`orka3-skill-combined.md`) for Claude Desktop projects
- VPN connection note for Claude Code users in README
- "Before You Respond" section in `SKILL.md` requiring environment probing (architecture, version, context) before answering any question or executing any command
- Operating Guidelines section in `SKILL.md` (formerly "Documentation & Troubleshooting Guidelines") with:
  - CLI patterns: Use built-in filtering instead of piping to grep
  - CI/CD authentication: Always use service accounts, never user tokens
  - Environment variables: Must be in CI/CD settings, not shell export
  - Network connectivity: Use curl to `/api/v1/cluster-info`, avoid ping
  - Troubleshooting approach: Trust CLI errors, understand execution context
  - Pre-flight checklist for all responses (not just documentation)
  - Example patterns for SSH troubleshooting in CI/CD environments

### Changed

- Restructured reference docs from 3 monolithic files into 18 domain-specific files under `references/commands/`, `references/workflows/`, and `references/troubleshooting/`
- Original monolithic files moved to `references/archive/`
- Updated SKILL.md with new reference documentation index pointing to chunked files
- Expanded README with Claude Code vs Regular Claude guidance, installation options, architecture support table

### Security

Addressed [W007] warning from Invariant MCP-scan (insecure credential handling, risk: 0.80):

- Updated OCI registry credential examples to use environment variables (`$REGISTRY_TOKEN`) instead of inline tokens
- Updated VM resize examples to use environment variables (`$VM_USER`, `$VM_PASSWORD`) for credentials
- Added security notes explaining that MacStadium base images use default credentials (`admin`/`admin`) which should be changed for production

Run `uvx mcp-scan@latest --skills` to verify.

### Documentation

- Added "Problem-Solving Approach" section with guidelines:
  - Define the problem first - push back on vague requests
  - Map the user journey before jumping to solutions
  - For Orka integrations: READ THE REPO ARCHITECTURE FIRST
  - Design/stub before implementing
  - Verify context and source of truth
  - Humans review every output

- Added "Pre-Flight Checklist for Documentation" with verification steps:
  - Problem definition and scope
  - Read the integration code first
  - Authentication patterns (service accounts only for CI/CD)
  - CLI patterns (no grep, use built-in filtering)
  - Execution context awareness
  - Content structure (one approach per problem)
  - Security (no hardcoded credentials)
  - Coherence check (cascade through all sections)
